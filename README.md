Project Title:
Fibonacci Generator Using Python

Project Overview:
The Fibonacci Generator project aims to create a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence follows the recurrence relation:
F(0)=1
F(1)=1
F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>2

Project Objectives:
1)Understand the Fibonacci sequence and its mathematical properties.
2)Implement the Fibonacci sequence generator using both iterative and recursive approaches.
3)Demonstrate the use of Python functions and control structures.
4)Provide insights into the performance differences between iterative and recursive methods.
